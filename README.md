Welcome to my SQL use case study utilizing the Famous Paintings & Museums dataset from Kaggle. This project showcases various SQL queries executed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes comprehensive information about famous paintings, their artists, and the museums where they are displayed. It encompasses details such as painting styles, prices, museum hours, and more. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings).

## Objectives

The aim of this project is to explore and analyze the Famous Paintings & Museums dataset through SQL queries. The queries are designed to extract valuable insights, clean data, and answer specific business questions.

## Key Queries

The project includes a variety of SQL queries, such as:

1. **Fetching paintings not displayed in any museums.**
2. **Identifying museums without paintings.**
3. **Counting paintings with an asking price higher than their regular price.**
4. **Finding paintings with an asking price less than 50% of their regular price.**
5. **Determining the most expensive canvas size.**
6. **Removing duplicate records from various tables.**
7. **Identifying museums with invalid city information.**
8. **Cleaning invalid entries in the Museum_Hours table.**
9. **Fetching the top 10 most famous painting subjects.**
10. **Identifying museums open on both Sunday and Monday.**
11. **Counting museums open every single day.**
12. **Determining the top 5 most popular museums based on the number of paintings.**
13. **Finding the top 5 most popular artists based on the number of paintings.**
14. **Displaying the 3 least popular canvas sizes.**
15. **Identifying the museum open the longest during a day.**
16. **Finding the museum with the most popular painting style.**
17. **Identifying artists whose paintings are displayed in multiple countries.**
18. **Displaying the country and city with the most museums.**
19. **Identifying the artist and museum with the most and least expensive painting.**
20. **Finding the country with the 5th highest number of paintings.**
21. **Determining the 3 most popular and 3 least popular painting styles.**
22. **Identifying the artist with the most Portrait paintings outside the USA.**
